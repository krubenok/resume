# Resume

Professional resume for [Kyle Rubenok](https://github.com/krubenok). See the latest version on [my webstie](https://nerd-ramblings.com/about) or in the releases section of this repo.

## How to Use

### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended. On macOS, run `brew install mactex` to get what you need.

### Usage

At a command prompt, run `xelatex resume.tex` This should result in the creation of ``resume.pdf``
